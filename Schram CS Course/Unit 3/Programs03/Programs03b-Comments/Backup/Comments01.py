# Comments01.py
# This program displays several number words.
# The focus now is on program comments.
# Program comments aid in "program documentation" 
# and makes your program more readable.  Every line 
# that begins with a "hashtag" is considered a 
# "comment" by the Python interpreter.
# The Python interpreter ignores all comments.  
# They are not executed.
# If a line begins with a hashtag, it is simply 
# ignored by Python. That is precisely what is 
# happening with the first 16 lines of this program.  
# Note below that a comment can also be placed in 
# the middle of the program.  They can even be placed 
# right after a program statement on the same line.
# You will also see that the word "Thirteen" is not 
# displayed because it has been "commented-out" 
# possibly by someone suffering from "Triskaidekaphobia" 
# (the fear of the number 13).
