# TextOutput04.py
# This program is very similar to the previous 
# program.  The only difference is that instead 
# of ending with a space, the first 2 <print> 
# commands <end> with an "empty string".  While 
# the first 3 outputs are still on the same line, 
# this time there is nothing in-between them.


print("Line1",end = "")
print("Line2",end = "")
print("Line3")
print("Line4")
