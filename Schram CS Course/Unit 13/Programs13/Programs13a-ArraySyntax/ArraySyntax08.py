# ArraySyntax08.py
# This program demonstrates that Python will allow
# you to display the entire contents of an array
# with a single <print> command.  The array is
# displayed in [brackets] seperated by commas.

# NOTE: Not all languages allow you to display
#       the contents of an array in this manner.
