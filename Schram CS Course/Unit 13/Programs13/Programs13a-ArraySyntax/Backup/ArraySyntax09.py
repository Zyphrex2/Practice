# ArraySyntax09.py
# This program demonstrates that Python technically  
# does not have "Arrays".  Python has "Lists".  
# A list is an ordered sequence of elements.
# An array is a list where all of the elements are 
# the same type. In spite of this, we will continue 
# to use Python lists as arrays.
